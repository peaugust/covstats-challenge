### RxSwift & RxCocoa

[RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) is a generic abstraction of computation expressed through Observable<Element> interface. Its intention is to enable easy composition of asynchronous operations and event/data streams.

RxCocoa provides Cocoa-specific capabilities for general iOS/macOS/watchOS & tvOS app development, such as Binders, Traits, and much more. It depends on both RxSwift and RxRelay.
